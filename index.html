                <div class="note-content">
	The kernel is the software that is in between the OS and the hardware. So it sets how the computer and the OS itself communicate with the hardware in which it is installed. The kernel is made of firmware, driveware, etc and a bunch of other things. There are several diff ways a kernel can be developed eg. microkernel, monolithic kernel -- if it has more or less features coz some of those features can be in the OS or in the kernel. 

Essentially: The kernel is what communicates between the OS and the hardware. 

So, nowadays, a lot of video games for computers have anti-cheats so u can't cheat while playing online. Those are loaded into the kernel. So they are pieces of software that are loaded into kernel i.e. the part of the software that comes between the OS and hardware itself to check if u are or not cheating in ur online game. 

The thing is, Linux uses a diff kernel than Windows. That means if anti-cheat software is required for a game and the anti-cheat software only works with Windows kernel, then the game cannot be imported to Linux. A lot of work has been done to import games from Windows to Linux that works flawlessly or quite well at least -- this has been an effort for (?) a gaming company behind Steam. 

And the games may run but if they have anti-cheat tech software installed they won't run on Linux. If the anti-cheat software aren't installed on Linux itself, it would be easier to port them to Linux. It's also a serious privacy concern for software being loaded into the kernel like that because it has basically access to everything (coz its the part that communicates between the OS and the hardware) so everything goes thru it in a way. So it has a lot of access to ur computer, so it's not the best in terms of privacy. So they're removing it from the kernel and putting it in the OS itself - this is good - coz then not only will games be able to run on linux. there will also be less concerns in terms of privacy so in a way its good.
